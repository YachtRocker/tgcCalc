Distance Calculator for The Golf Club Game

This program takes the distance, wind and elevation to calculate the corrected distance of a golfball from the hole.  This
information will allow for better use of selecting a golf club in the game "The Golf Club".

Currently has a GUI, but needs error checking and would like to allow the program to select the correct club also. 
Would also like to create a android app that uses this.

This is just for fun and learning experience with Python.
