Distance Calculator for The Golf Club Game

This program takes the distance, wind and elevation to calculate the corrected distance of a golfball from the hole.  This
information will allow for better use of selecting a golf club in the game "The Golf Club".

Planning on updating to a GUI and error checking in the future.

This is just for fun and learning experience with Python.
